# Git101 Commands

### To create a new Repository called - FirstRepo - from client (Git Bash) and then push it to the server

```sh
$ mkdir FirstRepo
$ cd FirstRepo
$ git init   #This will create the magical .git folder in this directory
```
>From now on, Git will track any changes (files added, modified and/or deleted) that occur in this folder

Create, add or edit files in this folder and when you have completed the changes

```sh
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "My first changes" #Any meaningful message of your choice
```
>You can keep making changes to the repository contents and commit as many changes as you want.

Once you are done with your changes, you would want to push this Repository on to the server and for this, you would need to create a skeleton of your Repository on the server and the name of the Repository on the server should match the Git Bash directory that you have created (FirstRepo in this case).

Go ahead & Create a Repository on the Server, make it a Public Repository and DO NOT choose - 'Initialize with a README'

GitHub displays the set of commands required to push contents from the Git Bash prompt and you would notice that it provides specific commands for HTTPS & SSH:

Let us use SSH URL and type in the following in Git Bash prompt to connect the local repository to the remote server

```sh
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:rchidana/FirstRepo.git
$ git push -u origin master
```
> -u option is to link the upstream URL since this is the first push that is occuring in this repository. For subsequent pushes, just $git push, will suffice since Git knows which local branch is linked to which branch in the upstream Repo

### To clone an existing Repository - SecondRepo - which has already been created on the GitHub Server

Let us create a New Repository called - SecondRepo on the Server and initialize it with a README.md file and then use the Repo URL to clone to on to our Client

>Do not forget to choose the option - Initialize this Repo with a README

Once the Repository is created, you can find the URL (either HTTPS or SSH):

![](images/SecondRepoURL.png?raw=true)

Use Git Bash and navigate to any place-holder folder (not within any existing Git Repository) and type in :

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:rchidana/SecondRepo.git
or 
$ git clone https://github.com/rchidana/SecondRepo.git
#If you use SSH URL, you are prompted for passphrase and if you use HTTPS URL, you will be prompted to enter your GitHub username (or registered email) & password
```

This will create a folder by name - SecondRepo - which is an exact replica of the Server Repository
